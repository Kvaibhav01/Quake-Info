###### Short description
The Quake Info app provides the updated list of earthquake occurrences happening around the globe. The list comes straight from the [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/) organization. Some of the key features of this app are:-

1. **Accurate and precise**: The earthquake list provides up-to-date and accurate information with zero errors. The data is in accordance with the USGS data.
2. **Detailed info**: The list provides the location, magnitude, time, date and approximated location. When you tap on it, it'll open the USGS site to show you more information related to that quake.
3. **Filters**: You have the full freedom to narrow down the list according to your preference. Filters can be applied according to the magnitude or recents. You can also set the minimum magnitude strength. 
4. **Real-time notifications**: Want to get the earthquake alert? The [Earthquake Notification Service (ENS)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/) from USGS can send you automated notification emails when earthquakes happen in your area. 
5. **Did you feel it?**: This feature shows how many people felt the specific earthquake in their region with its magnitude, perceived strength and location. [Note]: _This feature is still in beta._

Ah, I forgot to mention that comes with a sweet intro to give you a small tutorial. ðŸ˜‹
